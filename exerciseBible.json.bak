        "Another way to perform these is by using a smith machine though I do not recommend this.  The reason for not performing regular squats on the smith machine is that since the machine allows you to execute the exercise while leaning versus the bar, hip flexor involvement is minimized taking the hamstring out of the exercise.  While this does take pressure off the lower back, hamstring involvement is a requirement to stabilize the knee-cap.  So, as a result, what is created is a situation where destructive forces place a huge stress on the ACL (anterior cruciate ligament; a primary ligament in the knee capsule whose job is to provide knee stability) by pushing the knee-cap forward.  For this reason, I highly recommend against smith machine use for squats and if you still insist on doing so, make sure it is a sporadic use rather than frequent, and also be sure to control the amount of weight used."

        "\r\nYou can also use a barbell for this exercise.  Another way to perform these is by using a smith machine though I do not recommend this.  The reason for not performing regular squats on the smith machine is that since the machine allows you to execute the exercise while leaning versus the bar, hip flexor involvement is minimized taking the hamstring out of the exercise.  While this does take pressure off the lower back, hamstring involvement is a requirement to stabilize the knee-cap.  So, as a result, what is created is a situation where destructive forces place a huge stress on the ACL (anterior cruciate ligament; a primary ligament in the knee capsule whose job is to provide knee stability) by pushing the knee-cap forward.  For this reason, I highly recommend against smith machine use for squats and if you still insist on doing so, make sure it is a sporadic use rather than frequent, and also be sure to control the amount of weight used.\r\n"

This variation is referred to as weight-belt squats which need to be performed with the legs placed on two well secured, raised, but separated platforms, that allow the weights to go up and down in the middle. This exercise is an excellent choice for people with lower back problems.  The issue however is finding the platforms that meet the criteria.  The only way I have been able to perform this is when I have two benches placed opposite to each other with spotting platforms that are facing each other.  If you move the benches close enough then you get can execute the weight-belt squats by using the spotting platform.",
        "Finally, you can also perform squats in a Smith Machine though I do not recommend this.  The reason for not performing regular squats on the Smith Machine is that since the machine allows you to execute the exercise while leaning versus the bar, hip flexor involvement is minimized taking the hamstring out of the exercise.  While this does take pressure off the lower back, hamstring involvement is a requirement to stabilize the knee-cap.  So, as a result, what is created is a situation where destructive forces place a huge stress on the ACL (anterior cruciate ligament; a primary ligament in the knee capsule whose job is to provide knee stability) by pushing the knee-cap forward.  For this reason, I highly recommend against Smith Machine use for squats. If you still insist on doing so, make sure it is a sporadic use rather than frequent, and also be sure to control the amount of weight used."
